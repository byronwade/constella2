**Constella: A Next-Gen Cross-Platform File System Search & Indexing Tool**
===========================================================================

Constella is an advanced file system search and indexing tool that combines high-performance indexing, deep configurability, and an intuitive user interface. Inspired by modern code and document search platforms like grep.app, Constella aims to make full-text file search on your machine fast, flexible, and user-friendly.

Whether you're a developer working through large codebases, a researcher navigating extensive document archives, a content creator organizing media libraries, or an IT administrator managing system files, Constella adapts to your workflow. By leveraging Node.js for efficient I/O and parallelization, Electron for cross-platform desktop integration, and React for a dynamic, component-driven UI, Constella sets a new standard for local file search---faster, richer, and more intelligent than default system tools.

1. **Introduction**
-------------------
As storage capacity grows, so does the complexity of managing and finding files. Traditional OS-level searches are often slow, limited, or lack the sophisticated filtering needed to pinpoint the files you want. Constella overcomes these drawbacks by delivering lightning-fast, full-text search over massive collections of files---documents, code, media metadata, and more.

Constella provides a cohesive solution: it integrates seamlessly with your local file system, updates in real-time, and features a powerful yet approachable user interface. Whether you're filtering log files, scanning a code repository, or organizing a research dataset, Constella makes it easy to find exactly what you need.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. **Key Features**
-------------------

**Core Functionalities**
- **Full-Text Search:** Instantly locate text within thousands of files---beyond filenames, into file contents and metadata.
- **Advanced Querying:** Use regex, logical operators, file-type filters, date ranges, and size constraints to refine searches.
- **Real-Time Index Updates:** Constella continuously monitors directories so search results stay current as files change.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a uniform experience anywhere.

**Enhanced User Experience**
- **React-Based UI:** A responsive frontend offering real-time filtering, previews, and configuration panels.
- **File Previews:** View snippets, metadata, and relevant file properties directly in the interface, minimizing context switching.
- **Configurable Index Settings:** Define which directories to index, exclude certain file types, and schedule indexing intervals.

**Extensibility & Future-Ready**
- **Plugin Architecture (Planned):** Integrate with external tools, cloud storage, and custom indexing strategies.
- **AI-Assisted Features (Roadmap):** Natural language queries, voice commands, OCR for scanned documents, and intelligent content categorization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. **Technology Stack**
-----------------------
Constella leverages a modern and flexible stack:

- **Node.js (Backend):** Handles filesystem crawling, indexing, and querying with efficient async I/O. Offloads CPU-intensive indexing tasks to worker threads.
- **fdir (File Scanning):** A high-performance directory crawler, enabling rapid traversal of large file hierarchies.
- **Search Index (Inspired by sist2 & Elasticlunr):** Stores metadata and content summaries.
- **Electron (Integration):** Bundles the Node.js backend and React frontend into a cross-platform desktop application.
- **React (Frontend):** Provides a dynamic, component-driven UI that responds quickly to user actions and updates as the index changes.

Why These Choices?
- **Node.js:** Perfect for I/O-intensive tasks, offering non-blocking async operations and scalability.
- **fdir:** Efficient directory traversal for large file sets.
- **Electron:** Reliable cross-platform packaging, distributing a uniform experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **React:** Modern UI framework, ensures a fluid, interactive, and customizable user experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. **Architectural Overview**
-----------------------------
Constella consists of three main layers:

1. **Frontend Layer (React):**
 - Presents search interfaces, filters, and result lists.
 - Interacts with the backend via IPC calls (Electron) or REST endpoints.
 - Provides configuration panels for indexing settings, filters, and preferences.

2. **Backend Layer (Node.js):**
 - Uses `fdir` for rapid filesystem crawling.
 - Processes file content, builds and updates indexes using concepts from systems like `sist2`.
 - Handles queries, applies filters (regex, file type), and returns ranked results to the frontend.

3. **Desktop Integration (Electron):**
 - Packages the Node.js backend and React frontend into a desktop application.
 - Manages secure IPC, window creation, menu integration, and native OS interactions.

**Data Flow:**
- User inputs a query in the React UI.
- Query sent to Node.js backend via Electron IPC or HTTP calls.
- Backend queries the in-memory or on-disk index built from `fdir` scans.
- Results streamed back to the UI, displayed with content snippets and metadata.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. **Detailed Architecture & Data Flow**
----------------------------------------

**Indexing Process:**
1. User selects directories to index via the UI.
2. Backend traverses directories with `fdir`, collecting file paths and metadata.
3. For text-based files, the backend extracts content; for PDFs and other formats, it uses relevant parsers. Future OCR integrations may handle images.
4. The indexing logic builds an inverted index. Common approaches include using a JavaScript-based search library like `elasticlunr` or custom data structures.
5. Index commits occur periodically or when triggered by the user to maintain consistency.

**Query Execution:**
1. User enters a complex query (e.g., `modified:>2021-01-01 type:pdf "financial report"`).
2. Backend parses filters, file types, date ranges, and full-text search patterns.
3. The search index returns ranked matches with metadata and snippet highlights.
4. Backend enriches these results (paths, previews), then sends them to the UI for display.

**Real-Time Updates:**
- A file watcher (like `chokidar`) monitors indexed directories.
- Changes (edits, additions, deletions) trigger partial re-indexing of affected files.
- The UI receives updated results seamlessly without manual refresh.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. **Installation & Setup**
---------------------------
**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (latest recommended)
- npm or yarn (for frontend and backend dependencies)
- Electron (bundled automatically during packaging)

**Steps:**
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/constella.git
   cd constella
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This launches the React dev server and Node.js backend, and an Electron window should open automatically.
4. **Production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run package
   ```
   Generates a platform-specific binary for distribution.
